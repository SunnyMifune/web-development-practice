<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born and grew up in Taiwan. I love classical music and began violin study since 6 years old. Also, I have joined the Taipei civic symphony orchestra for 9 years since my freshman year in college.
  I really enjoy designing the page, making the page from 0 to functional brings me a sense of accomplishment, and that's why I am really interested in frontend work.</p>
